I looked through your **Life-Evolution-Simulation** log file, and here’s what stands out:

### What the log shows

* **Simulation reset:**
  At `18:20:00` both `[SYSTEM]` and `[USER_ACTION]` triggered a reset. That’s probably your main restart hook working correctly.

* **Food spawning:**
  Immediately after reset, tons of `[USER_ACTION] New food spawned` entries appear, each with `(x, y)` coordinates.
  Example: `(558, 205)`, `(482, 248)`, `(512, 211)`, etc.

* **Patterns noticed:**

  * Many duplicates, e.g. `(357, 395)` appears twice in the same second, `(634, 422)` appears three times, `(636, 132)` twice, `(619, 227)` twice, `(531, 323)` and `(530, 323)` (likely a rounding difference), `(453, 438)` twice, etc.
  * Food spawn density seems very high. Between `18:20:20` and `18:20:29`, over **40 food spawns** occurred in just ~9 seconds.
  * They’re clustered around certain ranges (400–700 x, 100–500 y), suggesting your food generation algorithm is constrained to a middle area of the simulation space.

### Possible interpretations

* **Duplicates** could mean:

  1. Your spawning logic is being called multiple times before state updates (race condition or loop overlap).
  2. You aren’t checking if a tile/location is already occupied before spawning.
  3. Your RNG might be seeded or biased in a way that repeats coordinates.

* **High spawn rate**: If this isn’t intentional, you may want to throttle food creation. In natural systems, food scarcity drives adaptation—right now, this looks more like an all-you-can-eat buffet.

* **Log granularity**: Every action is logged, which is fine for debugging, but for longer runs this will blow up quickly. You might want to batch or summarize (“10 food items spawned in region (x1,y1)-(x2,y2)”) to keep logs readable.

### Suggestions for next step

* Add a **spawn limiter** (e.g., max N food per tick, or only spawn if global density < threshold).
* Implement **duplicate prevention** (check if a coordinate already has food before spawning another).
* Add **diversity/randomness tweaks**: vary spawn clusters, use noise functions (Perlin, Simplex) to create natural “food zones.”
* Enhance logs with **entity IDs** (so you can trace which organism eats which food later).

Do you want me to reformat this log into a **visual map of food distribution** (like a scatterplot of `(x,y)` points) so you can actually *see* the spawning clusters? That would make it much clearer if duplicates are stacking.
